\FirstLine{O gracious Maker, bend thine ears}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{O}{ gracious Maker,} bend thine ears\\*
Unto our prayers and bitter tears; \\
May we this fast in truth now keep, \\*
Whilst thus we pray and humbly weep. 

	\flagverse{2}Thy piercing eye our hearts doth scan, \\*
And measure all the woes of man; \\
Whilst now, we sorrowing turn to thee,\\* 
From sinâ€™s foul burden set us free. 

	\flagverse{3}Much have we sinned, and to excess, \\*
But spare us, Lord, who thus confess; \\
And for the glory of thy name, \\*
Thy saving mercy now proclaim. 

	\flagverse{4}Whilst saving fasts our flesh subdue,\\* 
May thy sweet grace our hearts renew, \\
That vice may thus unfed remain, \\*
And we from sin and guilt abstain. 

	\flagverse{5}Grant us, O sacred Trinity, \\*
Grant us, O perfect Unity, \\
That these our fasts may fruitful prove \\*
Of endless bliss, in realms above. 
\end{verse}
