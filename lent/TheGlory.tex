\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\FirstVerse{T}{he glory} of these forty days\\
We celebrate with songs of praise;\\
For Christ, through whom all things were made,\\
Himself has fasted and has prayed.

\flagverse{2}Alone and fasting, Moses saw\\
The loving God who gave the Law;\\
And to Elijah, fasting, came\\
The steeds and chariots of flame.

\flagverse{3}So Daniel trained his mystic sight,\\
Delivered from the lions' might;\\
And John, the Bridegroom’s friend, became\\
The herald of the Savior’s name.

\flagverse{4}Then grant that we like them be true,\\
Consumed in fast and prayer with you;\\
Our spirits strengthen with your grace,\\
And give us joy to see your face.

\flagverse{5}O Father, Son and Spirit blest,\\
To you be ev'ry prayer addressed,\\
Who are in threefold name adored,\\
From age to age the only Lord.

\end{verse}
