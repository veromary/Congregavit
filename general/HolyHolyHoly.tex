\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\FirstVerse{H}{oly, holy, holy!} Lord God Almighty!\\
Early in the morning our song shall rise to thee.\\
Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty!\\
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!

\flagverse{2}Holy, holy, holy! All the saints adore thee,\\
casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;\\
cherubim and seraphim falling down before thee,\\
who wert, and art, and evermore shalt be.

\flagverse{3}Holy, holy, holy! Though the darkness hide thee,\\
though the eye of sinful man thy glory may not see,\\
only thou art holy; there is none beside thee\\
perfect in pow'r, in love, and purity.

\flagverse{4}Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!\\
All thy works shall praise thy name in earth and sky and sea.\\
Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty!\\
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!

\end{verse}
