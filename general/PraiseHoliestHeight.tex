\FirstLine{Praise to the Holiest in the height}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\begin{altverse}
\FirstVerse{P}{raise} to the Holiest in the height,\\*
And in the depth be praise;\\*
In all His words most wonderful,\\*
Most sure in all His ways.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{2}O loving wisdom of our God!\\*
When all was sin and shame,\\*
A second Adam to the fight\\*
And to the rescue came.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{3}O wisest love! that flesh and blood,\\*
Which did in Adam fail,\\*
Should strive afresh against the foe,\\*
Should strive and should prevail.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{4}And that a higher gift than grace\\*
Should flesh and blood refine,\\*
God’s Presence and His very Self,\\*
And Essence all divine.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{5}O generous love! that He, who smote,\\*
In Man for man the foe,\\*
The double agony in Man\\*
For man should undergo.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{6}And in the garden secretly,\\*
And on the Cross on high,\\*
Should teach His brethren, and inspire\\*
To suffer and to die.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{7}Praise to the Holiest in the height,\\*
And in the depth be praise;\\*
In all His words most wonderful,\\*
Most sure in all His ways.
\end{altverse}
