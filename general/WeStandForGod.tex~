\FirstVerse{W}{e} stand for God! And for His glory;\\*
The Lord supreme and God of all;\\*
Against His foes we raise His standard;\\*
Around the Cross we hear His call.

\begin{indentedVerse}
\flagverse{Chorus}\vin Strengthen our faith, Redeemer;\\*
\vin Guard us when danger is nigh;\\*
\vin To Thee we pledge our lives and service;\\*
\vin For God we live, for God we'll die,\\*

\vin For God we live, for God we'll die.

\flagverse{2}We stand for God! Jesus our Master\\*
Has died to save with love untold;\\*
His law divine and truth unchanging\\*
In this our land their place must hold.

\flagverse{3}We stand for God! In ages olden\\*
He placed ``the Cross'' our stars beside;\\*
Oh may our land gracious and golden\\*
Be faithful to the Crucified.
