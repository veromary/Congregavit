\FirstLine{My God, I love Thee; not because}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\FirstVerse{M}{y God,} I love Thee; not because\\
I hope for heav'n thereby,\\
Nor yet because if I love not\\
I must forever die.

\flagverse{2}Thou, O my Jesus, Thou didst me\\
Upon the cross embrace;\\
For me didst bear the nails and spear,\\
And manifold disgrace.

%(next verse not in Greg's copy)

\flagverse{3}And griefs and torments numberless,\\
And sweat of agony;\\
Yea, death itself---and all for me\\
Who was Thine enemy.

\flagverse{4}Then why, O blessèd Jesus Christ,\\
Should I not love Thee well?\\
Not for the sake of winning heav'n,\\
Nor of escaping hell.

\flagverse{5}Not with the hope of gaining aught,\\
Not seeking a reward;\\
But as Thyself hast lovèd me,\\
O ever-loving Lord.

\flagverse{6}So would I love Thee, dearest Lord,\\
And in Thy praise will sing;\\
Because Thou art my loving God,\\
And my eternal King.

\end{verse}
