\begin{patverse}
\FirstVerse{L}{ead}, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,\\*
Lead Thou me on;\\
The night is dark, and I am far from home,\\*
Lead Thou me on.\\
Keep Thou my feet; I do not ask to see\\*
The distant scene; one step enough for me.
\end{patverse}

\begin{patverse}
\flagverse{2}I was not ever thus, nor pray'd that Thou\\*
Shouldst lead me on;\\
I loved to choose and see my path; but now\\*
Lead Thou me on.\\
I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,\\*
Pride ruled my will: remember not past years.
\end{patverse}


\begin{patverse}
\flagverse{3}So long Thy power hath blest me, sure it still\\*
Will lead me on,\\
O'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till\\*
The night is gone;\\
And with the morn those Angel faces smile,\\*
Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.
\end{patverse}
