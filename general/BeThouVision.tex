\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{B}{e} Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart,\\*
 Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art;\\*
Thou my best thought in the day and the night,\\*
Waking and sleeping, Thy presence my light.

\flagverse{2}Be Thou my wisdom, be Thou my true word,\\*
I ever with Thee, and Thou with me, Lord;\\*
Thou my great Father, and I Thy true son;\\*
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.


\flagverse{3}Be Thou my breastplate, my sword for the fight;\\*
Be Thou my armour and be Thou my might;\\*
Thou my soul's shelter and Thou my high tower:\\*
Raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power.


\flagverse{4}Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise:\\*
Thou mine inheritance through all my days;\\*
Thou and Thou only the first in my heart;\\*
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.


\flagverse{5}High King of heaven, when the battle is done,\\*
Grant heaven's joys to me, O bright heaven's Sun,\\*
Christ of my own heart, whatever befall,\\*
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
