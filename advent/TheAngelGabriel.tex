\FirstLine{The angel Gabriel from heaven came}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\FirstVerse{T}{he angel Gabriel} from heaven came,\\
His wings as drifted snow, his eyes as flame;\\
``All hail,'' said he, ``thou lowly maiden Mary,''\\
``Most highly favoured lady!'' Gloria!

\flagverse{2}``For know a blessed Mother thou shall be,\\
All generations laud and honour thee,\\
Thy son shall be Emmanuel, by seers foretold.''\\
``Most highly favoured lady!'' Gloria!

\flagverse{3}Then gentle Mary meekly bowed her head;\\
``To me be as it pleaseth God!'' she said.\\
``My soul shall laud and magnify his holy name.''\\
``Most highly favoured lady!'' Gloria!

\flagverse{4}Of her, Emmanuel, the Christ, was born\\
In Bethlehem, all on a Christmas morn;\\
And Christian folk throughout the world will ever say:\\
``Most highly favoured lady!'' Gloria!

\end{verse}
