\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{S}{oul} of my Saviour, sanctify my breast;\\*
Body of Christ, be Thou my saving guest;\\*
Blood of my Saviour, bathe me in Thy tide,\\*
Wash me with water flowing from Thy side.

\flagverse{2}Strength and protection may Thy Passion be.\\*
O blessed Jesus, hear and answer me;\\*
Deep in Thy wounds, Lord, hide and shelter me;\\*
So shall I never, never part from Thee.

\flagverse{3}Guard and defend me from the foe malign;\\*
In death's dread moments, make me only Thine;\\*
Call me, and bid me come to Thee on high,\\*
Where I may praise Thee, with Thy saints for aye.
