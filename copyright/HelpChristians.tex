\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\FirstVerse{H}{elp} of Christians, guard this land,\\*
From assault or inward stain;\\*
Let it be what Christ has planned,\\*
His new Eden where you reign.

\flagverse{2} Teach us that in Christ your Son\\*
Lies the wisdom to be free;\\*
For the Cross, which we would shun,\\*
Is man's Tree of Liberty.

\flagverse{3} Should the powers of hell arise,\\*
And our peace be trampled down,\\*
In that night of blood and lies\\*
Show us still your twelve-starred crown.

\flagverse{4} Take from us the coward heart,\\*
Fleeting will, divided mind,\\*
Give us sight to play our part,\\*
Though the world around is blind.

\flagverse{5} Image of the risen life\\*
Shining in eternity,\\*
Glimmer through our earthly strife,\\*
Draw us to your victory.

\end{verse}
