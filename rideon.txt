1 The glory of these forty days
We celebrate with songs of praise;
For Christ, through whom all things were made,
Himself has fasted and has prayed.

2 Alone and fasting, Moses saw
The loving God who gave the Law;
And to Elijah, fasting, came
The steeds and chariots of flame.

3 So Daniel trained his mystic sight,
Delivered from the lions' might;
And John, the Bridegroom’s friend, became
The herald of the Savior’s name.

4 Then grant that we like them be true,
Consumed in fast and prayer with you;
Our spirits strengthen with your grace,
And give us joy to see your face.

5 O Father, Son and Spirit blest,
To you be ev'ry prayer addressed,
Who are in threefold name adored,
From age to age the only Lord.

and great wealth; whilst his mother, Silvia, and her sisters-in-law, Tarsilla
and Aemiliana, attained the distinction of canonization. Gregory made the best
use of his advantages in circumstances and surroundings, so far as his
education went. "A saint among saints," he was considered second to none in
Rome in grammar, rhetoric, and logic. In early life, before his father's death,
he became a member of the Senate; and soon after he was thirty and ac… Go to

days, by M. F. Bell, in The English Hymnal, 1906, No. 68. [Rev. James Mearns,
