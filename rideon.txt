Choral

[c5383] OUR HEARTS REJOICE THIS DAY

Representative Text

1 This joyful Eastertide,
away with sin and sorrow!
My Love, the Crucified,
has sprung to life this morrow:

Refrain:
Had Christ, who once was slain,
not burst His three-day prison,
our faith had been in vain;
but now has Christ arisen,
arisen, arisen;
but now has Christ arisen!

2 Death’s flood has lost its chill
since Jesus crossed the river;
Lover of souls, from ill
my passing soul deliver: [Refrain]

3 My flesh in hope shall rest
and for a season slumber
till trump from east to west
shall wake the dead in number: [Refrain]

Author: George Ratcliffe Woodward

Educated at Caius College in Cambridge, England, George R. Woodward (b.
Birkenhead, Cheshire, England, 1848; d. Highgate, London, England, 1934) was
ordained in the Church of England in 1874. He served in six parishes in London,
Norfolk, and Suffolk. He was a gifted linguist and translator of a large number
of hymns from Greek, Latin, and German. But Woodward's theory of translation
was a rigid one–he held that the translation ought to reproduce the meter and
rhyme scheme of the original as well as its contents. This practice did not
always produce singable hymns; his translations are therefore used more often
today as valuable resources than as congregational hymns. With Charles Wood he
published three series of The Cowley Carol Book (19… Go to person page >

Notes

Scripture References;
st. 2 = 1 Cor. 15:51-52
ref. = 1 Cor. 15:14, 20

George R. Woodward (b. Birkenhead, Cheshire, England, 1848; d. Highgate,
London, England, 1934) wrote the text of this Easter carol to fit the VRUCHTEN
tune. The text expresses the joy Christ's resurrection brings to believers (st.
1); that joy provides a sense of security throughout our lives (st. 2) and
gives confidence even in the face of death (st. 3). The hymn was first
published in Woodward's Carols for Easter and Ascension (1894), which later
became a part of the 1902 edition of his famous Cowley Carol Book.

Educated at Caius College in Cambridge, England, Woodward was ordained in the
Church of England in 1874. He served in six parishes in London, Norfolk, and
Suffolk. He was a gifted linguist and translator of a large number of hymns
from Greek, Latin, and German. But Woodward's theory of translation was a rigid
one–he held that the translation ought to reproduce the meter and rhyme scheme
of the original as well as its contents. This practice did not always produce
singable hymns; his translations are therefore used more often today as
valuable resources than as congregational hymns. With Charles Wood he published
three series of The Cowley Carol Book (1901, 1902, 1919), two editions of Songs
of Syon (1904, 1910), An Italian Carol Book (1920), and the Cambridge Carol
Book (1924). Much of the unfamiliar music introduced in The English Hymnal
(1906) resulted from Woodward's research. He also produced an edition of the
Piae Cantiones of 1582 (1910) and published a number of his translations in
Hymns of the Greek Church (1922).

Liturgical Use:
Easter season; funerals.

Tune

VRUECHTEN

VRUCHTEN is originally a seventeenth-century Dutch folk tune for the love song
"De liefde Voortgebracht." It became a hymn tune in Joachim Oudaen's David' s
Psalmen (1685) as a setting for "Hoe groot de vruchten zijn." The tune is
distinguished by the melismas that mark the end of stanza lines and b…
