\begin{patverse}
\initialV{F}{or} all the saints who from their labours rest,\\*
        Who Thee by faith before the
world confessed,\\*
    Thy name, O Jesu be
    forever blessed,\\*
        Alleluia, Alleluia!
\end{patverse}

\begin{patverse}
\flagverse{2}Thou wast their rock, their fortress, and their might;\\*
        Thou, Lord, their captain in the well-fought fight;\\*
    Thou in the darkness drear their one true light.\\*
        Alleluia, Alleluia!
\end{patverse}

\begin{patverse}
\flagverse{3}Oh, may Thy soldiers,
    faithful,
    true,
    and bold,\\*
Fight as the saints who nobly fought of old,\\*
    And win, with them, the victors' crown of gold.\\*
        Alleluia, Alleluia!
\end{patverse}

\begin{patverse}
\flagverse{4}Oh blest communion! fellowship divine!\\*
        We feebly struggle, they in glory shine;\\*
    Yet all are one in Thee, for all are Thine.\\*
          Alleluia, Alleluia!
\end{patverse}

\begin{patverse}
\flagverse{5}And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,\\*
        Steals on the ear the distant triumph-song,\\*
    And hearts are brave again, and
    arms are strong.\\*
        Alleluia, Alleluia!
\end{patverse}

\begin{patverse}
\flagverse{6}The golden evening brightens in the west;\\*
        Soon, soon to faithful warriors cometh rest:\\*
    Sweet is the calm of paradise the blest.\\*
        Alleluia, Alleluia!
\end{patverse}

\begin{patverse}
\flagverse{7}But lo!    there    breaks a    yet more glorious day;\\*
        The saints triumphant rise in bright array:\\*
The King of glory passes on His way.\\*
Alleluia, Alleluia!
\end{patverse}

\begin{patverse}
\flagverse{8}From earth's wide bounds, from ocean's farthest coast,\\*
        Through gates of pearl streams in the countless host,\\*
    Singing to Father, Son and Holy Ghost.\\*
        Alleluia, Alleluia!
\end{patverse}
