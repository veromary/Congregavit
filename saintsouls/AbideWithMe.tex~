\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{A}{bide} with me; fast falls the eventide;\\*
The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide.\\
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,\\*
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.

\flagverse{2}Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;\\*
Earth’s joys grow dim; its glories pass away;\\
Change and decay in all around I see;\\*
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.

%Not a brief glance I beg, a passing word;\\*
%But as Thou dwell’st with Thy disciples, Lord,\\
%Familiar, condescending, patient, free.\\*
%Come not to sojourn, but abide with me.

%Come not in terrors, as the King of kings,\\*
%But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings,\\
%Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea—\\*
%Come, Friend of sinners, and thus bide with me.

%Thou on my head in early youth didst smile;\\*
%And, though rebellious and perverse meanwhile,\\
%Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee,\\*
%On to the close, O Lord, abide with me.

\flagverse{3}I need Thy presence every passing hour.\\*
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s power?\\
Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?\\*
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.

\flagverse{4}I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;\\*
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.\\
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?\\*
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.

\flagverse{5}Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;\\*
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies.\\
Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;\\*
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.

\end{verse}
