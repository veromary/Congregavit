\FirstVerse{T}{his} joyful Eastertide,
\vin away with sin and sorrow!
My Love, the Crucified,
\vin has sprung to life this morrow:
\end{indentedVerse}

\begin{indentedVerse}
\flagverse{Refrain:}Had Christ, who once was slain,\\
\vin not burst His three-day prison,\\
Our faith had been in vain;\\
But now has Christ arisen,\\
\vin arisen, arisen!
\end{indentedVerse}

\vin since Jesus crossed the river;
Lover of souls, from ill
\vin my passing soul deliver: [Refrain]

\flagverse{3}My flesh in hope shall rest
\vin and for a season slumber
Till trump from east to west
\vin shall wake the dead in number: [Refrain]
