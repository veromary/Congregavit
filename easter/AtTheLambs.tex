%\begin{altverse}
\FirstVerse{A}{t} the Lamb's high feast we sing,\\*
Praise to our victorious King,\\
Who hath washed us in the tide\\*
Flowing from His piercèd Side;\\\pointorig
Praise we Him, whose love Divine\\*
Gives His Sacred Blood for wine,\\
Gives His Body for the feast,\\*
Christ the Victim, Christ the Priest.
%\end{altverse}

\flagverse{2}Where the Paschal blood is poured,\\*
Death's dark Angel sheathes his sword;\\
Israel's hosts triumphant go\\*
Through the wave that drowns the foe.\\
Praise we Christ, whose blood was shed,\\*
Paschal Victim, Paschal Bread;\\
With sincerity and love\\*
Eat we Manna from above.

\flagverse{3}Mighty Victim from the sky,\\*
Hell's fierce pow'rs beneath Thee lie;\\
Death is conquered in the fight,\\*
Thou hast brought us life and light;\\
Now Thy banner Thou dost wave;\\*
Vanquished Satan and the grave;\\
Angels join His praise to tell---\\*
See o'erthrown the prince of hell.
%Now no more can death appall,
%Now no more the grave enthrall;
%Thou hast opened Paradise,
%And in Thee Thy saints shall rise.

\flagverse{4}Paschal triumph, Paschal joy,\\*
%Only sin can this destroy;
%From sin's death do Thou set free
%Souls reborn, O Lord, in Thee.
Only sin can this destroy;\\
From the death of sin set free,\\*
Souls re-born, dear Lord, in Thee.\\
Hymns of glory, songs of praise,\\*
Father, unto Thee we raise;\\
Risen Lord, all praise to Thee,\\*
Ever with the Spirit be.

\end{verse}
