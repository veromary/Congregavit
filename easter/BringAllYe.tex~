\FirstVerse{B}{ring,} all ye dear-bought nations, bring \\*
Your richest praises to your King,\\*
Alleluia, alleluia,                 \\
That spotless Lamb, who more than due, \\*        
Paid for His sheep, and those sheep you,  \\*     
Alleluia, alleluia,\\ 
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.

\flagverse{2} The guiltless Son, who bought your peace,       \\*                                  
And made His Father's anger cease,\\*
Alleluia, alleluia,                  \\
Then, life and death together fought,   \\*       
Each to a strange extreme were brought.        
%Alleluia.

\begin{patverse}
\flagverse{3} Life died, but soon revived again, \\* 
And even death by it was slain.                \\*
Alleluia, alleluia,                            \\
Say, happy Magdalen, oh say,                  \\*
What didst thou see there by the way?

\flagverse{4} ``I saw the tomb of my dear Lord,            \\*
I saw Himself and Him adored,                  \\*
Alleluia, alleluia,                            \\
I saw the napkin and the sheet,                \\*
That bound His head and wrapped His feet. 
%Alleluia.

Jesus is ris'n; He is not here;        \\*        
Alleluia, alleluia,                       \\ 
Go, tell His followers they shall see,       \\*  
Thine and their hope in Galilee.         
%Alleluia.''

\flagverse{6} We, Lord, with faithful hearts and voice,              \\*
On this Thy rising day rejoice.                \\*
Alleluia, alleluia,                            \\
O Thou, whose power o'ercame the grave,            \\*
By grace and love us sinners save.      
%Alleluia.
