May long alone to gaze upon Thy face.

And teach us how to do Thy blessed will;\\*
To follow close the print of Thy dear footsteps,\\*
And when we fall, sweet Heart, Oh, love us still.

\flagverse{4}Sweet Heart of Jesus, bless all hearts that love Thee,\\*
And may Thine own Heart ever blessed be;\\*
Bless us, dear Lord, and bless the friends we cherish,\\*
And keep us true to Mary and to Thee.
