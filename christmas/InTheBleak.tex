\FirstLine{In the bleak midwinter}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\FirstVerse{I}{n the bleak midwinter,} frosty wind made moan,\\
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;\\
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,\\
In the bleak midwinter, long ago.

\flagverse{2}Our God, heaven cannot hold him, nor earth sustain;\\
Heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign.\\
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed\\
The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.

\flagverse{3}Angels and archangels may have gathered there,\\
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;\\
But his mother only, in her maiden bliss,\\
Worshiped the beloved with a kiss.

\flagverse{4}What can I give him, poor as I am?\\
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;\\
If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;\\
Yet what I can I give him: give my heart.

\end{verse}
