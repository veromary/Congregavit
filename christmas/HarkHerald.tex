Born to raise the sons of earth,\\*
Born to give them second birth.

%Come, Desire of nations, come,
%Fix in us Thy humble home;
%Rise, the woman’s conqu’ring Seed,
%Bruise in us the serpent’s head.
%Now display Thy saving power,
%Ruined nature now restore;
%Now in mystic union join
%Thine to ours, and ours to Thine.

%Adam's likeness, Lord, efface,
%Stamp Thine image in its place:
%Second Adam from above,
%Reinstate us in Thy love.
%Let us Thee, though lost, regain,
%Thee, the Life, the inner man:
%O, to all Thyself impart,
%Formed in each believing heart.

\end{verse}
