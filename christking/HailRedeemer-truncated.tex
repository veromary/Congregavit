\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{H}{ail} Redeemer, King divine!\\*
Priest and Lamb, the throne is Thine;\\*
King, whose reign shall never cease,\\*
Prince of everlasting peace.

\begin{indentedVerse}
\flagverse{Chorus:}\vin Angels, saints and nations sing :\\*
\vin Praised be Jesus Christ our King;\\*
\vin Lord of life, earth, sky and sea,\\*
\vin King of love on Calvary!
\end{indentedVerse}

\flagverse{2}King most holy, King of truth,\\*
Guard the lowly, guide the youth;\\*
Christ Thou King of glory bright,\\*
Be to us eternal light.

\flagverse{3}Shepherd-king, o'er mountains steep\\*
Homeward bring the wandering sheep;\\*
Shelter in one royal fold\\*
States and kingdoms, new and old.

\flagverse{4}Eucharistic King, what love\\*
Draws Thee daily from above,\\*
Clad in signs of bread and wine :\\*
Feed us, lead us, keep us Thine!

\flagverse{5}King, whose name creation thrills,\\*
Rule our hearts, our minds, our wills;\\*
'Till in peace, each nation rings\\*
With Thy praises, King of kings.

\end{verse}
