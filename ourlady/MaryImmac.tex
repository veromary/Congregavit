\settowidth{\versewidth}{Mary immaculate, star of the morning}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\FirstVerse{M}{ary} immaculate, star of the morning,\\*
Chosen before the creation began,\\*
Chosen to bring for thy bridal adorning,\\*
Woe to the serpent and rescue to man.

\flagverse{2} Here in an orbit of shadow and sadness\\*
Veiling thy splendour, thy course thou hast run;\\*
Now thou art throned in all glory and gladness,\\*
Crowned by the hand of thy Saviour and Son.

\flagverse{3} Sinners, we worship thy sinless perfection;\\*
Fallen and weak, for thy pity we plead;\\*
Grant us the shield of thy sovereign protection,\\*
Measure thine aid by the depth of our need.

\flagverse{4} Frail is our nature and strict our probation,\\*
Watchful the foe that would lure us to wrong;\\*
Succour our souls in the hour of temptation,\\*
Mary immaculate, tender and strong.

\flagverse{5} See how the wiles of the serpent assail us,\\*
See how we waver and flinch in the fight;\\*
Let thine immaculate merit avail us,\\*
Make of our weakness a proof of thy might.

\flagverse{6} Bend from thy throne at the voice of our crying,\\*
Bend to this earth which thy footsteps have trod;\\*
Stretch out thy hand to us living and dying,\\*
Mary immaculate, Mother of God.
